             <h2>Amul- The Taste Of India</h2>
             <p>Amul is an Indian dairy state government cooperative society, based at Anand in Gujarat. Formed in 1946, it is a cooperative brand managed by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF), which today is jointly controlled by 36 lakh milk producers in Gujarat, and the apex body of 13 district milk unions, spread across 13,000 villages of Gujarat. Amul spurred India's White Revolution, which made the country the world's largest producer of milk and milk products. Word AMUL stands for Anand Milk Union Limited.

                Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel under the guidance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel became the founding chairman of the organization and led it until his retirement in the 70s. He hired Verghese Kurien in 1949 and convinced him to stay and help with the mission. Under the chairmanship of Tribhuvandas, Kurien was initially the general manager and helped guide the technical and marketing efforts of Amul. Kurien was the chairman of Amul briefly after Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel died in 1994. Kurien, founder-chairman of the GCMMF for more than 30 years (1973â€“2006), is credited with the success of Amul's marketing.
